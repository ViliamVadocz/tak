# AlphaTak

## About

An implementation of [AlphaZero] for the abstract strategy board game [Tak].

The goal of this project is to advance the state of the art in Tak-playing agents
and to experiment with the Rust Machine Learning ecosystem.

Previously, I have successfully used the [tch-rs] crate (wrapper for libtorch)
for this project. I am now trying [dfdx] instead to reduce the friction when building.
With [tch-rs], users had to manually install libtorch which made building
quite error-prone for the non-technical audience.
Hopefully with [dfdx] building will be much easier.
